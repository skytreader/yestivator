Something personal!!!!

## Set-up and running

This needs the python-notify library---Python's bindings for libnotify. For some
reason, it can't be installed via pip. So, outside a virtualenv, do `sudo apt-get install python-notify`
and then create your virtualenv with the `--system-site-packages` option.

Inside your virtualenv, add the required libraries as usual.
